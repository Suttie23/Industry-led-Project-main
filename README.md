Edinburgh College Coursework Software Engineering HND

## Brief
The college currently host a vehicle booking system delivered free through php Schedule-It but due 
to the design and functionality of the software itâ€™s not allowing us to utilise the booking of our 9 
electric cars to their full potential. 
We require a booking system that would allow a vehicle to be booked by multiple users at different 
times throughout the day, although our current booking system does to this, when you make a 
booking it shows the start time and end time but no booking can be made within that period if the 
vehicle was parked up not getting used. All our vehicles are tracked through UK Telematics so this 
would give the location of what campus the vehicles could be collected from prior to booking a 
vehicle.
The top image shows the vehicle diary displaying vehicle availability and current bookings and the 
image below shows a booking form the user completes to book a vehicle.

## Key Requirements

- System has to have the ability to store multi-user profiles.
- Bookings can be made for a car when the vehicle is not in use between a start time and end time. When a booking page has been set up we require the user to state the travel time for going then the time for traveling back on the booking system and this would show the available time for a secondary booking to be made between these times.
- Ability to notify the booking software of arrival/departure of a vehicle at campus through a mobile phone or desktop app.
- Bookings can be made through mobile phone app and desktop application.
- Integration of the booking system with the tracker software.
- Email notification of bookings and cancelations.
- Admin rights for authorised people to create a user and set vehicle booking permissions.
